          <p>The world's first home automation app for Android wear</p>
        </a>

        <p>Q42 was at <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io">Google I/O</a>, Google's annual developer conference in San Francisco on June 25th and 26th.
        We were part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io/sandbox">sandbox</a> together with our friends from Philips, to answer developer questions about Hue, connected devices and the Internet of Things.</p>

        <p>The result: we had a ton of visitors, Larry Page loved our booth, and we launched one of the very first Android Wear apps, which was featured at the main Android Wear presentation. We met a gazillion awesome fellow nerds and other inspiring people, learned cutting edge stuff at sessions and workshops, were interviewed, and had a lot of fun.</p>
